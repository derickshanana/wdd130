    <h1>Paris, France</h1>

    <p>
        Paris is my favorite city because of its rich history, beautiful architecture,
        and global cultural influence. It is the capital city of France and is often
        referred to as the "City of Light."
    </p>

    <p>
        The city is famous for iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre
        Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris is also known for its art, fashion,
        cuisine, and vibrant city life.
